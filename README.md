# Build an Image Segmentation Model for Medical Diagnosis using CNN, PyTorch and OpenCV

In healthcare and medical science, the fusion of artificial intelligence and deep learning is revolutionizing diagnostics. My project focuses on the precise segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy imagesâ€”a vital tool for medical practitioners.

In this project, we aim to develop an image segmentation model using Pytorch.


## Data

The use of the CVC-Clinic database, containing frames from colonoscopy videos. The dataset includes polyp frames and corresponding ground truth images in both PNG and TIFF formats.


## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Albumentations
